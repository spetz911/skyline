      |CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript.
      |Underneath that awkward Java-esque patina, JavaScript has always had a gorgeous heart.
      |CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way.
      |
      |The golden rule of CoffeeScript is: "It's just JavaScript".
      |The code compiles one-to-one into the equivalent JS, and there is no interpretation at runtime.
      |You can use any existing JavaScript library seamlessly from CoffeeScript (and vice-versa).
      |The compiled output is readable and pretty-printed, will work in every JavaScript runtime,
      |and tends to run as fast or faster than the equivalent handwritten JavaScript.
